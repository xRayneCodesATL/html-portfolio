<h1>The Best Movies According to Rayne</h1>
<h2>The GOATs</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Rocky Horror Picture Show</h3>
<p>Tim Curry + Meat Loaf + Susan Sarandon = gold. [Not exactly the reason I love this movie, but their acting doesn't hurt.] Let's do the Time Warp again?</p>
<h3>Jennifer's Body</h3>
<p>I love a good slasher, Megan Fox and dark comedy. What more do you need in a movie?</p>
<h3>Malignant</h3>
<p>A terrifingly good time! One of the best, high-octane plot twists of all time.</p>
